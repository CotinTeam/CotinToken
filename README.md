Become the ultimate treasure hunter and claim all of the Cotin Stashes, or invest in Cotin for a chance to receive a portion of each claimed stash.
Join us on this exciting adventure where you can turn your love of exploration into something truly profitable!

---A QUICK TUTORIAL---
Step 1: Track Active Stashes
The Active Stashes page shows the list of all open challenges where treasure chests assigned a large quantity of Cotin are hidden somewhere in the wild, waiting patiently to be claimed.
As chests are located and stashes are claimed, the Active Stashes page will be updated accordingly.  New Active Stashes will be routinely added to the site.
Cotin Chests are highly engineered devices that contain the Cotin Stash.  Every Active Stash will have its own dedicated Cotin Chest, hidden somewhere in the wild and awaiting its discovery.
Each Cotin Chest is designed to operate based on the details of the Active Stash challenge.  
See further details about the Cotin Chest below.

---THE COTIN CHEST---
The Cotin Chest is what makes Cotin stand out from other cryptocurrencies.
Chests have been designed not only for aesthetics, but for numerous variations and functions.
Each chest contains special electronic hardware designed with unique capabilities depending on the challenge at hand.
Some chests may emit light at certain time windows, whereas others may respond to their environment, such as a certain musical note or score. 
Chests and their internal hardware are engineered to maintain function over the entirety of the Active Stash Challenge, and each chest uses the proper materials to not disturb their surrounding environment.

Where to Find Cotin Chests
The placement of each chest will coincide with the lore of Cotin.
Whether the chest is submerged in a riverbed, hidden along a coastline, or resting near a cove, all locations will be near the water.
Locating a chest will not require excessive gear, as each chest will be made accessible to treasure hunters of all ages.

---THE COTIN STASH---
The Cotin Stash refers to the Cotin volume (and potentially other valuables) that will be assigned to each Cotin Chest.
A portion of Cotin's overall volume is reserved for the Cotin Stashes.
This specific volume is only obtainable by participating in the Active Stash Challenges.
Each chest contains a portion of these reserves and will be unlocked/distributed once a chest is located and Stash is claimed.

Distribution Within the Cotin Community
Cotin was not only created for the fearless treasure hunters - instead it prioritizes the entire Cotin community.
Cotin uses a shared distribution function to allow every Cotin holder to reap the rewards of each claimed Cotin Stash.
This means that you can participate either as a treasure hunter, investor, or both to earn Cotin.
The more percentage of overall market volume that you hold, the higher percentage of the total payout you will receive when each Cotin Stash is claimed.
